# Tailwind CSS Learning Repository

## What is Tailwind CSS?

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that empowers developers to build custom designs directly in their HTML. Unlike traditional CSS frameworks, Tailwind offers low-level utility classes that allow you to create unique designs without needing to write custom CSS from scratch. This approach provides greater flexibility and control over your design process.

### Key Features:
- **Utility-First**: Focuses on building components using utility classes.
- **Responsive Design**: Easily create responsive layouts with built-in breakpoints.
- **Customization**: Fully customizable with a configuration file to define your design system.
- **Performance**: Purges unused styles in production to reduce file size.
